<p>The Dashboard was created using Power BI, a data visualization and business intelligence tool. The data used in the dashboard was sourced from a given link, and subsequently uploaded to Google Big Query. The dashboard was then connected to the Google Big Query, and data was imported into the dashboard from Google Big Query</p>

<p>The dashboard features a selector in the top left corner, which allows the user to select a specific year for displaying data based on the reported year. Below this selector is another selector for the month, which enables the user to select a month name for displaying data based on that particular month. The month selector is dynamically updated based on the year selected by the user.</p>

<p>On the top right of the dashboard, there are several scorecards which display the total number of employees laid off, the total number of companies reporting layoffs, the total number of industries affected by layoffs, and the total number of sources reporting layoffs.</p>

<p>The dashboard also includes a bar chart that displays the count of layoffs with respect to the company. The bar chart shows only the top ten companies with the highest number of layoffs. Another horizontal bar chart shows the top ten sources that reported layoffs.</p>

<p>A map of the headquarters of the companies with the highest number of layoffs is also featured in the dashboard. The map enables the user to visually identify the location of the companies most affected by layoffs.</p>

<p>The dashboard includes a pie chart that displays the layoffs with respect to the company status, indicating whether a company is public or private.

Lastly, the dashboard features a treemap that shows the top five industries with the highest number of layoffs. The treemap enables the user to quickly identify the industries most affected by layoffs.</p>

<p>In summary, the dashboard provides an interactive and informative data visualization of the data obtained from Google Big Query. The user can select a specific year and month to view the data and can easily identify the most affected companies, sources, industries, and employee layoffs.</p>
